/// <p>Creates a managed fleet of Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instances to host your containerized game servers. Use this operation to define how to deploy a container architecture onto each fleet instance and configure fleet settings. You can create a container fleet in any Amazon Web Services Regions that Amazon GameLift Servers supports for multi-location fleets. A container fleet can be deployed to a single location or multiple locations. Container fleets are deployed with Amazon Linux 2023 as the instance operating system.</p>
/// <p>Define the fleet's container architecture using container group definitions. Each fleet can have one of the following container group types:</p>
/// <ul>
/// <li>
/// <p>The game server container group runs your game server build and dependent software. Amazon GameLift Servers deploys one or more replicas of this container group to each fleet instance. The number of replicas depends on the computing capabilities of the fleet instance in use.</p></li>
/// <li>
/// <p>An optional per-instance container group might be used to run other software that only needs to run once per instance, such as background services, logging, or test processes. One per-instance container group is deployed to each fleet instance.</p></li>
/// </ul>
/// <p>Each container group can include the definition for one or more containers. A container definition specifies a container image that is stored in an Amazon Elastic Container Registry (Amazon ECR) public or private repository.</p>
/// <p><b>Request options</b></p>
/// <p>Use this operation to make the following types of requests. Most fleet settings have default values, so you can create a working fleet with a minimal configuration and default values, which you can customize later.</p>
/// <ul>
/// <li>
/// <p>Create a fleet with no container groups. You can configure a container fleet and then add container group definitions later.
